I tried to do the codes but my computer lagged hence had to do it in google colab. And as the library was new to me there are some places i skipped using it. It is really difficult doing this in this short time and there were a tragedy(as you might have heard from news) I quite got a short time for participation and we have a hefty of academic pressure as the endsem is coming. So try to ignore little mistakes.
